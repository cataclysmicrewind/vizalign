	VizAlignTextFieldTarget
	
	
	
re-architect Aligners so they share more common code. not sure how though

think about abstracting the DisplayObject dependency out and you can give it classes at runtime that are acceptable to use, 
thusly it can also create more VizAlignTarget types	

	what if the vizAlignTarget class accepts * and then each class cracks the whip on which class is acceptable?
	what if i have a VizAlignGenericTarget that is *
