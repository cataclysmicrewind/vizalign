"Aligning your shit cause you hate the IDE"


Seriously, VizAlign is a simple library that allows you to vizually align DisplayObject. A simple straightforward API with flexibility boasting 34 alignment methods makes VizAlign an amazing tool.


I made this library because of designers. My experience is that they are not even aware of the origin point of a Library asset (or DisplayObject), thus creating tons of hassle for everyone.

This library can ignore whatever nasty origin locations your designer throws at you.


==It's the Flash IDE align panel, but in code during runtime!, and way better ;)==
