h2. align your graphics the way you see it.

VizAlign is powerful, extendable, alignment utility that allows you to *vizually align* DisplayObject. it is a new way of thinking about aligning, and will forever change your alignment habits. when you position something, you expect it to end up where you envision it; VizAlign helps you do that. the core is so extendable i never run out of new feature ideas. documentation is something i see as vital so i hope the information you find here is helpful to working with VizAlign. 


***

*disclaimer:* although i feel confident about the code i have written, i cannot guarantee it is bug free. i do not have unit tests (but looking for help on writing them!)
<br>
we are currently on version 0.6. this is the first public release.

***

<br/>

h3. features:
	
* *natural api*: i want to align these [targets] to the [left of the stage].
* *40* alignments (and more coming!)
* *extend* - able framework 
* returns results for *animation* or storage
* *group* - ing!

<br/>

h2. powerful api:  
	
	@Aligners:@ objects that align Rectangle. they need a targetCoordinateSpace (thing that doesn't move) and targets (things that do move).
	@VizAlignment:@ each alignment needs two things: a targetCoordinateSpace and an aligner.
	@VizAlign:@ the butler to the alignments. give him the targets and the alignments you have created, he will make sure they happen.
	
<pre><code>var aligner:IRectangleAligner = new CenterAligner();
var targetCoordinateSpace:* = stage;
var alignment:VizAlignment = new VizAlignment(aligner, targetCoordianteSpace);
var results:Array = VizAlign.align ([targets], [alignment], ignoreOrigins, applyResults, pixelHinting);</code></pre>

	@ignoreOrigins:@ if true, VizAlign will treat each target as if 0,0 for it is at the top left of the graphics.
	@applyResults:@ if true, VizAlign will move the target to the calculated alignment
	@pixelHinting:@ if true, VizAlign will round all of the calculations by Math.round();
	@return:@ array of VizAlignTarget in the same order you sent your targets in as.

<br/>

h3. show me:

come on down and take a look at the capabilities swf, which will let you play around with VizAlign, get used to how it works, and learn all the alignments available!

<br>

h2. change the way you think about alignment:
	
alignment of objects is always a pain, in almost all environments i have worked in the learning curve is frustrating. why? because positioning is never natural. VizAlign hopes to solve this problem. tell me, how often has this come up in your life:
	
* _i wish i could make this always stay centered on that_
* _i want this to fill this area but maintain its aspect ratio_
* _i want these graphics to be spaced evenly inside this area_
* _i want these two objects, treated as one, to move next to this other object_
* _i want this object to always be 30% of the height of this object (in development!)_
	
the way you think about the alignments, the words you use to describe them are exactly how VizAlign functions.

<br/>

h4. first, lets look at the main function call align():
	
h6. NOTE: taken directly from the source code! yes, there is documentation!

<pre><code>
/**
 * aligns the specified targets how the vizAlignments specify.
 * 
 * this function is the main point of entry when using VizAlign. this is the function that will do _all_ the work for you. 
 * this is the only function in this library that will handle origins/rotation points completely for you.
 * all you must do is specify the flag ignoreOrigin. 
 *  
 *  
 * @param    targets         array of DisplayObject/VizAlignTarget/VizAlignGroup/Array for targets to be aligned. 
 *                           (they will all be converted to VizAlignTarget/VizAlignGroup accordingly.)
 * @param    vizAlignments   an array of VizAlignment that specify how you want the targets to be aligned. 
 * @param    applyResults    whether you want VizAlign to actually move the targets or just calculate the end position
 * @param    ignoreOrigin    whether you want VizAlign to ignore the origin offset.
 * @param    pixelHinting    whether VizAlign should round the end result before finishing.
 * 
*/

VizAlign.align (targets:Array, alignments:Array, ignoreOrigins:Boolean = false, applyResults:Boolean = false, pixelHinting:Boolean = false);
</code></pre>

h4. you want: 
	
to align the two rectangles to scale to fit inside the stage, then center them to the stage. <br> oh, and ignore their origins, move the targets for me and make sure they get put on whole values.

h4. example:
    
h6. NOTE: i use a ficticous `RectangleSprite` to remove boilerplate code from the example. <br>
    function RectangleSprite (parent:DisplayObjectContainer, x:int, y:int, w:int, h:int, color:uint);

<pre><code>
var redRect :RectangleSprite = new RectangleSprite(stage, 0, 0, 100, 100, 0xFF0000);
var blueRect:RectangleSprite = new RectangleSprite(stage, 0, 0,  10,  50, 0x0000FF);
var targets:Array = [redRect, blueRect];

var scaleToFit:VizAlignment = new VizAlignment (new ScaleToFitAligner(), stage);
var center    :VizAlignment = new VizAlignment (new CenterAligner()    , stage);
var alignments:Array = [scaleToFit, center];

var ignoreOrigins:Boolean = true;  // do not include the origin point of the DisplayObject when calculating
var applyResults :Boolean = true;  // have VizAlign move the objecst to the end result
var pixelHinting :Boolean = true;  // round the results to the nearest whole value

VizAlign.align (targets, alignments, ignoreOrigins, applyResults, pixelHinting);

/*
 * below is a shorthand way of doing this
 *
*/
var redRect :RectangleSprite = new RectangleSprite(stage, 0, 0, 100, 100, 0xFF0000);
var blueRect:RectangleSprite = new RectangleSprite(stage, 0, 0,  10,  50, 0x0000FF);

var scaleToFit:VizAlignment = new VizAlignment (new ScaleToFitAligner(), stage);
var center    :VizAlignment = new VizAlignment (new CenterAligner()    , stage);

VizAlign.align ([redRect, blueRect], [scaleToFit, center], true, true, true);
</code></pre>

h2. gotcha!

	*targets != parent & child*
	
if you send a parent and its child as targets to the same alignment call, you are likely to get results that are not what you expect. VizAlign will modify the x,y,widht,height values of each target. by changing a parent, that will cause the child to move with it. in some cases this might not actually effect anything but those are extremely rare. 
	
h4. example of it becoming a problem:
	
h6. this will look really wrong! for more information view the wiki page on this problem (coming)
	
<pre><code>
package {
    public class Main {
        public function Main():void {
            var tcs:RectangleSprite = new RectangleSprite(stage, 0, 0, 300, 300, 0xAACCFF);
            VizAlign.align([tcs], [new VizAlignment (new CenterAligner(), stage)], true, true, true);
            
            var greenGuy:RectangleSprite = new RectangleSprite(stage   ,  10,  10, 100, 100, 0x00FF00);
            var brownGuy:RectangleSprite = new RectangleSprite(greenGuy, 110, 110,  10,  50, 0x623131);
			
            VizAlign.align ([brownGuy, greenGuy], [new VizAlignment (new CenterAligner(), tcs)], true, true, true);
        }
    }
}
// simple class to remove boilerplate from main function.
class RectangleSprite extends Sprite {
    public function RectangleSprite(parent:DisplayObjectContainer, x:int, y:int, w:int, h:int, color:uint) {
        graphics.beginFill(color);
        graphics.drawRect(0, 0, w, h);
        this.x = x; this.y = y;
        parent.addChild(this);
    }
}
