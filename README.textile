h3. "aligning your shit cause you hate the IDE"

<hrule>
Seriously, VizAlign is a simple library that allows you to vizually align ``DisplayObject``. A simple straightforward API with flexibility boasting 40 alignment methods makes VizAlign an amazing tool.

h3. super simple api:  
	
<code>VizAlign.align ([targets], [alignments], ignoreOrigins, applyResults, pixelHinting);</code>


h3. features:
	
 * simple api
 * 40 alignments
 * extendable framework
 * returns results for animation or storage
 * grouping!


h3. why

I made this library because of designers. My experience is that they are not even aware of the origin point of a Library asset (or DisplayObject), thus creating tons of hassle for everyone.

This library can ignore whatever nasty origin locations your designer throws at you.


h3. It's the Flash IDE align panel, but in code during runtime!, and way better ;)
