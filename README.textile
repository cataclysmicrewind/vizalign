h1. bq calm your ocd

h4. It's the Flash IDE align panel, but in code during runtime!, and way better ;)

VizAlign is a simple library that allows you to *vizually align* <code>DisplayObject</code>. a simple straightforward API with flexibility, boasting 40 alignment methods, and grouping makes VizAlign an amazing tool.

h3. super simple api:  
	
<code>VizAlign.align ([targets], [alignments], ignoreOrigins, applyResults, pixelHinting);</code>


h3. features:
	
* *natural api*: i want to align these [targets] to the [left of the stage].
* *40* alignments (and more coming!)
* *extend* able framework 
* returns results for *animation* or storage
* *group* ing!


h3. why:

I made this library because of designers. My experience is that they are not even aware of the origin point of a Library asset (or DisplayObject), thus creating tons of hassle for everyone.

This library can ignore whatever nasty origin locations your designer throws at you.
