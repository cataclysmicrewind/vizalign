h4. like the Flash IDE align panel, but in code during runtime!

@VizAlign@ is a simple library that allows you to *vizually align* <code>DisplayObject</code>. a natural straightforward API boasting flexibility, 40 alignment methods, and grouping makes VizAlign an amazing tool.

h3. super simple api:  
	
<code>VizAlign.align ([targets], [alignments], ignoreOrigins, applyResults, pixelHinting);</code>


h3. features:
	
* *natural api*: i want to align these [targets] to the [left of the stage].
* *40* alignments (and more coming!)
* *extend* - able framework 
* returns results for *animation* or storage
* *group* - ing!


h3. why:

i made this library because of designers. my experience is that they are not aware of the origin point of a library asset (or DisplayObject), thus creating tons of hassle for everyone. it was also my first project when as3 came out. i have certainly learned a lot from this project. so i started.
i wanted a tool that would make alignment simple, something that just worked, something that would ignore what flash thinks, and puts my graphics exactly where i expect them to go. this, is @VizAlign@.
